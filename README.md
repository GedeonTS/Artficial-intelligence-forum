> Welcome to my Microverse's Capstone 1 project, the international artificial intelligence forum website. In this project, we are given with a [template design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015) and we are asked to make our own website with a different subject - which in my case is the international artificial intelligence forum!This is a responsive website that navigates from the home page to the about page, follow mobile first sticks to the template design as much as possible.
